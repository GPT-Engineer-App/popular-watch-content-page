# popular-watch-content-page

### Short Description
The Most Watched Content Page displays the currently most-watched movies and TV shows with filter and sort options. It integrates ratings from Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, OMDb, and TMDb. Additionally, it provides a weekly summary and offers genre filtering.

### Prompt Explanation
The Most Watched Content Page is designed to showcase popular content, allowing users to filter by type (movies/shows) and genre, and sort by views, rating, or date. It integrates multiple APIs (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, OMDb, TMDb) to retrieve comprehensive ratings and movie data. A weekly summary highlights trends, and the page dynamically updates based on user-selected filters and sorting criteria. The page is built using React and Chakra UI, with Axios handling API requests.
